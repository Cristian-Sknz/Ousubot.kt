## Work in Progress!
This bot is being developed, it is not yet available on discord and is only with the code available as open-source. There is no set deadline for the first release.

## :scroll: What is ousu?
Ousu is a discord bot that lets you show information about everything related to osu with some of the things a competitive or casual player needs to know! Ousu is able to display your information in interactive and slightly fun ways, like music previews and information from your favorite beatmaps, among others.


## :jigsaw: Dependencies
If you want something more detailed, take a look at build.gradle

> Soon the bot will be fully configurable for self-hosting, still missing features that are incomplete.
